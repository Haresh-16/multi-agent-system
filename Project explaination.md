Here's how you can explain this project to an interviewer — in a structured, confident, and technically fluent way — covering both the **agentic AI principles** and the **deployment/infrastructure readiness**.

---

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch

> *“I built a multi-agent GenAI system that can reason over research papers and public APIs to assist medical legal teams in preparing patent filings. It uses LangGraph to orchestrate agents with shared memory, dynamically enriches its context when internal sources are insufficient, and tracks full state transitions and citations to ensure traceability.”*

---

## 🔧 1. What Makes It an **Agentic AI System**

* I designed a system where **multiple agents collaborate**, each with a specific responsibility:

  * `DecomposerAgent`: breaks down complex questions
  * `RetrieverAgent`: answers using conversational + document context
  * `SynthesizerAgent`: consolidates sub-answers into a coherent summary
  * `ValidatorAgent`: checks whether the response fully answers the original question
  * `ExplainerAgent`: elaborates further if needed
* Agents are **composable**, **reason independently**, and operate on **shared state** — a key principle of agentic AI.

---

## 🔁 2. How LangGraph Was Used for Orchestration

> *“LangGraph let me define the multi-agent flow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with memory and state transitions preserved between nodes.”*

* Each agent is mapped to a **LangGraph node**, and I used:

  * `StateGraph` for sequential execution
  * `ParallelFor` for answering multiple sub-questions in parallel
* State is updated incrementally (e.g. adding `"subquestions"`, then `"responses"`, etc.)
* This enables agents to build on each other’s outputs **without tight coupling**

---

## 🌍 3. Context-Aware Reasoning via **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

> *“When my validator detects missing context, the system enriches itself by calling a real MCP-compliant public API (PubMed).”*

* This mimics how human agents would pull external documents to support a claim
* Retrieved external context is cached in Redis and injected back into the state
* This improves answer quality in data-sparse scenarios, making the system **autonomous and adaptive**

---

## 🧱 4. Infrastructure & Deployment Readiness

> *“I designed the system to be fully stateless, horizontally scalable, and cloud-friendly.”*

* ✅ **FastAPI** serves the web API and manages background tasks
* ✅ **Redis** handles session state, memory, and intermediate agent results
* ✅ The agent pipeline is run asynchronously for responsiveness
* ✅ Full state (`state_transitions`) is logged per session, enabling:

  * Auditing
  * Resuming
  * Monitoring

### Deployment-ready design:

* Deployable on ECS, GKE, or serverless with no session stickiness
* Redis can be swapped with ElastiCache for production
* LangChain agents are stateless; workflows are restartable

---

## 🧠 5. Framework Knowledge

* **LangChain**: used for memory, prompt templating, LLM abstraction
* **LangGraph**: enables visual and programmable agent orchestration
* **FastAPI**: gives me full control over background processing and REST/WS endpoints
* **Redis**: fast, persistent state store for context and session memory

## 🎯 Interview-Winning Wrap-Up

> “This project shows how to take an LLM from a question-answering tool to a full autonomous agent system that thinks, reacts, adapts, and cites. I designed both the agent logic and the deployment architecture to make this real-world usable for high-stakes legal and medical workflows.”

### 🗣️ **Agentic AI System for Medical-Patent Assistance** (2-Minute Summary)

> I built an agentic AI system that helps medical legal teams analyze research papers and assist with patent filings. The system can answer complex questions using both private documents and external public APIs.

> The architecture is based on **LangGraph**, which I used to orchestrate a workflow of independent but collaborative agents. Each agent has a clear role — for example, a decomposer breaks down queries, retrievers answer subquestions using memory, a synthesizer summarizes, and a validator checks if the response is sufficient.

> What makes this system intelligent is that if the validator detects that more context is needed, it automatically reaches out to a public **MCP-compliant API** — like PubMed — and reprocesses the query with that new external knowledge. This mimics how a human legal assistant would do research when they don’t know the answer internally.

> I used **LangChain** for memory and LLM prompting, and **FastAPI** with **Redis** for session tracking, background processing, and persistence. The whole system is stateless and horizontally scalable — deployable on ECS, Lambda, or GKE with no dependency on sticky sessions.

> Finally, the system tracks all state transitions and includes citations in the final output — so the lawyer knows where the answer came from, whether it was internal or external.

> This project shows how agentic workflows can be applied to real-world, high-trust domains, and demonstrates my ability to design both AI reasoning flows and the cloud-ready infrastructure to deploy them.
