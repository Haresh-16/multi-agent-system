To deploy your entire agentic AI system on **AWS**, here‚Äôs a clean, scalable, and cost-effective architecture with just the right services ‚Äî optimized for production, but simple enough to manage.

## üöÄ 1. üß± High-Level Architecture

```
User ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda (FastAPI) ‚Üí Redis (ElastiCache)
                          ‚Üì
              LangGraph Agent Pipeline (via LangChain)
                          ‚Üì
         External MCP API (PubMed) if needed
                          ‚Üì
           S3 (for PDFs) and CloudWatch (for logs)
```

## üîß 2. Components & How to Deploy

### ‚úÖ A. **FastAPI App (Your Backend)**

* **Option 1 (easy + serverless)**: Deploy with **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** using [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) or [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/).
* **Option 2 (scalable)**: Use **AWS ECS Fargate**

  * Dockerize the app
  * Deploy via ECS with a load balancer
  * Auto-scale based on traffic

**Steps (ECS option):**

```bash
# Dockerize your app
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "agentic_ai_final:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

* Push image to **ECR**
* Create ECS task + service
* Expose via **Application Load Balancer**

---

### ‚úÖ B. **Redis for State & Memory**

* Use **AWS ElastiCache (Redis)** with:

  * A single node (dev)
  * Or a multi-node cluster (prod)
* Replace your local Redis config with:

```python
redis.Redis(host="your-elasticache-endpoint", port=6379)
```

---

### ‚úÖ C. **S3 for Uploaded Documents**

* Let users upload PDFs to a secure S3 bucket
* Use pre-signed URLs from FastAPI to upload
* Store the S3 key as `paper_url` in the session

---

### ‚úÖ D. **External API (MCP)**

Already built into your system:

```python
requests.get("https://mcpdemo.fly.dev/api/context/pubmed", params={"q": query})
```

No change needed ‚Äî this calls a public MCP server.

---

### ‚úÖ E. **Logging & Monitoring**

* Use **CloudWatch Logs** for:

  * Background task tracing
  * Agent output logging
* Optional: Add **X-Ray** to trace agent timings

---

### ‚úÖ F. **Secrets Management**

* Store OpenAI keys (or any LLM provider) in:

  * **AWS Secrets Manager**, or
  * **Parameter Store (SSM)**

Load them securely into your app at runtime.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 3. Security & Access

* Use IAM roles for:

  * ECS to access S3 and Secrets Manager
  * Lambda (if used) to read from Redis/S3
* Enable TLS (HTTPS) on ALB or API Gateway
* Secure S3 buckets with IAM and pre-signed access

---

## üß™ 4. CI/CD (Optional but Recommended)

* Use **GitHub Actions** or **CodePipeline** to:

  * Build Docker image
  * Push to ECR
  * Deploy to ECS via ECS deploy action or CLI

---

## ‚ö° 5. Cost Optimization

| Service     | Notes                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ECS Fargate | Pay-per-use, scale to zero if idle     |
| Lambda      | Best for low-traffic, bursty workloads |
| ElastiCache | Choose smallest instance in dev        |
| S3          | Pay-per-GB for PDF storage             |

---

## üß† Bonus: Fully Serverless Version

* Replace ECS with **API Gateway + Lambda (Zappa)**
* Use **AWS Step Functions** to simulate the LangGraph pipeline
* Redis via **ElastiCache or DynamoDB TTL**

* A Dockerfile + ECS task definition example?
* A Terraform config to automate it?
* A GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow to build & deploy?
